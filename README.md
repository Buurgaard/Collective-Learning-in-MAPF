# Collective-Learning-in-MAPF
Code for Master project at SDU called "Collective Learning in Multi-Agent Path Finding" 

The simulation is built on top of the simulation environment developed by Abderraouf Maoudj and Anders Lyhne Christensen. The original simulation was developed for the research in Decentralized Multi-Agent Path Finding in Warehouse Environments for Fleets of Mobile Robots with Limited Communication Range from 2022. The simulation code is found at the following git repository: https://github.com/Amaoudj/ANTS2022.git
