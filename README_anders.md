# Swarm Robotics for I4.0 Simple Simulator

This simulator is developed as part of the "Swarm Robotics for I4.0" research project. The goal is to enable the simulation on embodied agents operating in a discrete world. The world is a graph where nodes are locations and edges denote connectivity between locations.

# Getting started

From a terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anderslyhne/swarm4I40sim.git

cd swarm4I40sim

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run an example from the terminal:

```sh
python -m swarmI4 -c configfiles/example.conf
```
